Files for StanCon 2023 tutorial: _Fundamentals of Stan_.

Instructor: Charles Margossian
Teaching Assistant: Manny Mokel

The R notebook can be run using Colab. Participants are expected to write their own Stan files for the exercises (solutions are under the models directory). In Colab, create a model directory and a new text file under `model/`. Naming the file with the `.stan` extension creates a Stan file.
