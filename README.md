# stan_tutorial
This repo contains files for various workshops I teach on Stan (and sometimes the extension Torsten). Material for the following courses can be found here:
* _Fundamentals of Stan_. (StanCon 2023, TA: Manny Mokel)
* _Bayesian Workflow for Hierarchical and ODE-based Models in Stan_. (Advanced Summer School on Bayesian Methods 2023, TA: Maxime Fajgenblat, in progress...)

R notebooks can be run using Colab. Participants are expected to write their own Stan files for the exercises (solutions will be provided). In Colab, create a model directory and a new text file under `model/`. Naming the file with the `.stan` extension creates a Stan file.
